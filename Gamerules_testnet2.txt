
General notes
-------------

 This is Huntercoin as it was in version 1.2 with lots of things added:
  Equipped weapons and items
  NPCs to buy these from
  Safe zones and teleporters
  Character levels (and near immortal hunters)
  Monsters roaming the map
  A decentralized bounty and voting system

 The game aims to demand only 1 move per day from players, making it possible for "players with jobs" to play competitively.

 As a side effect, use of bots to gain an advantage is completely impossible.
 The game also generates very few transactions, making it much more scalable.


 Map layout:

 Map center and the 4 color team bases are safe zones, combat is not possible here.
 Four 2-way teleporters connect the center and the bases. Players of other colors can't walk
 across the base perimeter (the tiles marked on map are still within the safe zone).

 To teleport, stand still on the bright glowing tile.

 Player characters can have equipped items that determine their combat abilities.
 They will use their weapon automatically if hostiles are in range and not able to resist.
 Equipment can be bought by running over the tile of a merchant NPC.

 Movement in safe zones is the same as in Huntercoin (set path/waypoint with mouse click or ctrl-click, and "Go" button).

 When a character starts to move, the last waypoint (end point of path) becomes the ordered target for next round (1 round == 2000 blocks)
 if the final waypoint of the path is within 12 tiles distance to one of the flag poles (aka "Points of Interest").
 otherwise the order is an unspecific "stay here".


 Outside safezones:

 If stepping on a tile outside of safe zones, the path/waypoints is forgotten, but not the ordered target.
 Everyone will wait till begin of next round before going to that point.
 If the order was given less than 500 blocks before the old round ended, it may not be effective for the new round,
 and will only go into effect 1 round later. (i.e. 500 blocks = 100% chance, 250 blocks = 50% chance)

 Movement orders to battlefield areas are irrevocable, and fights between characters are AI controlled.
 Combat results depend only on character equipment and tactical situation. There are no hitpoints.



Weapons
-------

If not resisted, all weapon effects are lethal (1 chronon until death)

(***) maximum 7



Monsters
--------

Monsters can't be controlled with waypoints.
If a monster finds a heart, a normal soldier is created.
Members of the weakest (color) team can't die but are converted to monsters instead.
Members of other teams but the strongest are converted to monsters only if less monsters than PCs exist.



Monster attacks
---------------

Redhead                spell equivalent to Staff of Fire Balls
Zombie                 spell equivalent to Staff of Poison Cloud
Reaper                 spell equivalent to Staff of the Reaper


monster apocalypse: when a new round begins, monsters roam the map in search for coins.
                    When facing an enemy, they fight unless outclassed (mons have same character level requirements as anyone else)
                    or outnumbered 2:1.

 -> monsters will not attack their former color/team mates
 -> monsters resist the damage effect of their own spell if attack strength < clevel



Items
-----

Amulet/Ring of Word of Recall          teleport to base, if failing morale check for 25 consecutive blocks (being chased by strong monster)

Amulet of Life Saving                  teleport to base *instead* of death
                                       this will destroy the amulet

Plate Mail                             resist all damage effects if their strength < min(your character level, 3)
                                       -2 range penalty when using staves

Splinted Mail                          resist damage effects if their strength < min(your character level, 3)
                                       but not effective against lightning
                                       -2 range penalty when using staves

Chain Mail                             resist damage effects if their strength < min(your character level, 3)
                                       but not effective against lightning and fire
                                       -1 range penalty when using staves

Ring Mail                              resist damage effects if their strength < min(your character level, 3)
                                       but not effective against lightning, poison and fire
                                       -1 range penalty when using staves

Amulet of Regeneration                 If the wearer is converted into a monster, it will slowly regenerate and become a normal PC again,
                                       (this process is halted when less than 1/3 of all characters are monsters)


AI + spell packages (free items):

Book of Conquest                       Standard setting for passing/failing morale check

Book of Survival                       Less overconfidence. Run away to fight another day

Book of Resting                        like Book of Survival, additionally recall to base if no order for new round was given

Book of Mark and Recall                like Book of Resting, additionally:
                                       Memorize where you have been (the area). When order for new round was given,
                                       teleport there, then walk to ordered target.
                                       (for teleportation, the area's marker flag must be same color, or white)



Balance between colors and between players and monsters
-------------------------------------------------------

 The game will resurrect dead hunters as merchant NPC or monster
  if the dead hunter was a member of the weakest color team
  or the dead hunter was not member of the strongest team and there are less monsters than hunters
  or the number of monsters is less than half the number of hunters.

 Monsters are always AI controlled and retain loyality to their team.

 (The AI of) every character will be overconfident in combat
  if the number of monsters is less than half the number of hunters
  or In case of more characters on map than target value
 This is high risk, high reward. Players can still choose to stay home at their team's base.

 In case of less characters on map than target value, hearts will spawn (like in old Huntercoin times).
 Running over a tile with a heart creates a free (no coins locked) character.


Upkeep and Survival Points
--------------------------

 Player characters need 1 ration per round to survive. Rations are automatically bought and delivered.
 Starving players are logged out and refunded.

 1 survival point (SP) is the reward for surviving a round, they are required for the "Command Champion" spell,
 to get the help of the strongest monster of same color in combat. After the spell has been used, the
 second strongest monster becomes the new champion and so on, while the required SP minimum goes lower with every block.
 This will give new players a chance to win battles, even when the map is already crowded with leveled characters.


All drinkables are delivered once per round with the rations:

Pazunia Sun Ale                        if failing morale check and choosing an area to retreat, don't go back to area ordered by player

Pale Sweet Marrow                      go back once

Red Pit Ichor                          while the order is in effect, keep going back until the area is cleared
                                       (or you die or teleport out with Word of Recall)



Character level requirements
----------------------------

new character          20 coins (paid from wallet)

clevel 2               100 coins (looted on map)
clevel 3               200 coins
clevel 4               400 coins
clevel 5               800 coins
clevel 6               1600 coins
clevel 7               3200 coins
clevel 8               6400 coins
clevel 9               12800 coins



 -> stepping on spawn strip (in one of the corners) delevels the character to back to lvl 1 and sends all coins to the wallet
 -> staying on spawn strip for 30 blocks liquidates the character (only possible when setting path to walk back and forth on the strip)


Bounty and voting system
------------------------

 Any player can request that all players vote of whether a specified bounty is granted. Format (console command):

name_update Alice {\"msg_request\":\"1000\",\"msg_fee\":\"20\",\"msg_comment\":\""some text, perhaps link to forum post"\"}

 In this example, Alice requests that a NPC sends 1000 coins to hunter Alice. If not specified, the fee is 1% of the requested amount.
 Note the extra quotes in msg_comment, they are needed if the text contains any spaces.

 The fee is paid immediately to the NPC. Alice will get rations for it, so that the fee slowly refunds itself.

 Every 5 rounds (10000 blocks, or 1000 if devmode=8) the network chooses the request with the highest fee, and it goes into voting,
 which also lasts 10000 blocks. To vote:

name_update Bob {\"msg_vote\":\"1000\"}

 or

name_update Bob {\"msg_vote\":\"0\"}

Or anything in between. It's not possible to vote for less than 0 or more than the requested amount. If the median vote is 0
or the requested amount, then the actual bounty is the median (otherwise the average)

Voters are rewarded with 3 rations, plus 2 rations for each heart soldier. The "soft" population limit imposed by the price per ration
would be doubled if all players vote regularly.


The bounty can be symbolic and less than the fee. In this case it's a simple Yes/No voting.



Network-wide devmode
--------------------

Devmode is only available on testnet, and after the 3. red character has died and became NPC.
Console commands:

name_update devmode 3                                  manual movement only, allow normal waypoints everywhere

name_update devmode 5                                  allow normal waypoints everywhere

name_update devmode 6                                  cowardly monsters (run away if not outnumbering the enemy 2:1,
                                                       normally they would run away if outnumbered 2:1)

name_update devmode 7                                  aggressive monsters (only flee if outclassed)

name_update devmode 8                                  - 1 round == 200 blocks (normally 2000)
                                                       - automode after "waiting for orders" for 100 blocks (normally 1000)
                                                       - orders must be given 50 blocks before round ends to have 100% chance
                                                         for being effective next round (normally 500)

name_update devmode x                                  devmode off (network-wide)



Client only devmode (doesn't send a transaction)
------------------------------------------------

name_update devmode 1                                  monster color and equipped items (obsolete due to icons)
name_update devmode 2                                  AI verbose
name_update devmode f                                  not used
name_update devmode t                                  not used
name_update devmode 0                                  default
